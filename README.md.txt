 User Behavior Analytics – Conversion Rate Prediction

 Project Overview
This project predicts website session conversions using Google Analytics data, providing actionable insights for marketing and business optimization. It demonstrates an end-to-end machine learning workflow: from data cleaning and feature engineering to model training and deployment-ready serialization.

## Key Features
-Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:** Handle missing values, parse nested data, and transform features.
-Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualize trends and key factors affecting user conversions using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
- Machine Learning Model:** Logistic Regression trained with Scikit-learn to predict user conversions accurately.
- Model Serialization:** Save trained model using Pickle for reuse without retraining.
