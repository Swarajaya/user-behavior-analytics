📊 User Conversion Prediction Dashboard

This project is a machine learning–powered web application that predicts whether a user will convert (e.g., make a purchase or sign up) based on website interaction data.

 What This Project Does

Takes user inputs:

Sessions

Page Views

Time on Site (seconds)


Uses a trained machine learning classification model

Predicts conversion likelihood

Displays results through an interactive dashboard


This type of system is commonly used in digital marketing, e-commerce analytics, and user behavior analysis.



🧠 Machine Learning Workflow

1. Data collection and cleaning


2. Feature selection (sessions, pageviews, time on site)


3. Model training (classification)


4. Model evaluation


5. Deployment with an interactive UI
