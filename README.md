interactive Spiral Visualization & User behavior Analytics 
is project is a Python-based interactive web application developed using Streamlit that visualizes mathematically generated spiral patterns. Users can dynamically adjust parameters such as the number of turns and the number of data points through sliders, and the visualization updates in real time.

To enhance the project from an analytics perspective, Google Analytics was integrated to track user behavior, including session activity and interaction patterns. This allowed practical application of web analytics concepts such as engagement tracking and user behavior analysis.
